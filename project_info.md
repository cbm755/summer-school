Presentations
=============

Each group of 2, 3, or 4 students should present the results of one
project.  You can choose the image processing project or the surface
computing project.  These can be found on
[github.com/cbm755/summer-school](https://github.com/cbm755/summer-school).


You presentation should be 10 minutes long plus a few minutes for
questions or discussion.

Please:

1) Summarize you problem, assuming the audience does not know about
your topic.  That is, present the work to an audience that has not
done this summer school.

2) Discuss the numerical methods you use.

3) Present the results of the project.

4) Talk about limitations of the method, any problems encountered,
future work ideas, etc.

You should prepare some slides or other computer document.  For
example, Powerpoint, LaTeX beamer, Matlab "publish", etc.  Please
prepare a presentation which summarized the key problem, numerical
method, solutions, etc for a general audience.  Please do not assume
the audience understands finite difference methods for example.
