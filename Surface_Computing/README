This folder contains lecture notes and project description for the surface computing course.

The implementations of Closest Point Method, including the codes 
example_heat_sphere.m and example_RD_sphere.m needed for doing course project,
can be found from another git repo: https://github.com/cbm755/cp_matrices.
You might want to start with the examples folder.
To actually make the codes in examples folder work, you have to git clone
or download the whole repo. I'll talk more about this repo and bring a USB
copy of it during Monday's lecture.
